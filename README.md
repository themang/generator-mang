Generate the Mang.


## Getting Started

### What is the Mang?

Well... it's the man. It helps you get an angular app up and running super fast and let's you `require` @visionmedia's components, bower components, and node modules. Plus it's super conducive to structuring your app as a set of modules. Oh ya ... and we made testing easy as well.


### Setup

```
$ npm install -g yo
$ npm install -g generator-mang
```

### Create a new app

```
$ yo mang [appName]
```

Add a library.

```
$ cd [appName]
$ yo mang:lib [libName]
```
